## Information
This is a project I made for my girlfriend last Valentines Day. I changed some of the text and material as it was personal. This is just a GUI using tkinter in python. It consists of some message boxes, button functions, and an automated drawing.
## Installation
Download the .exe file and the code folder, simply execute the .exe file afterwards once they're in the same directory.
